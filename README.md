# House Price Prediction using Linear Regression

## Overview

This project implements a **Linear Regression Model** to predict house prices based on key features such as **square footage**, **number of bedrooms**, and **number of bathrooms**. The model is built and trained using Python, with libraries like NumPy, pandas, and scikit-learn. This project is ideal for beginners in machine learning and serves as a practical demonstration of how regression techniques are applied in real-world scenarios.

## Features

- **Input Features**:
  - Square footage of the house.
  - Number of bedrooms.
  - Number of bathrooms.
- **Prediction Output**:
  - Estimated price of the house.
- **Model Evaluation**:
  - Metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and RÂ² Score to assess model performance.
- **Data Visualization**:
  - Plots showing feature relationships, residuals, and model fit.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - pandas: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
  - NumPy: For numerical computations.
  - scikit-learn: For building and evaluating the regression model.
  - matplotlib & seaborn: For data visualization.

## Dataset

- The dataset contains details about houses, including square footage, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, and their corresponding prices.
- Sample datasets (like the Boston housing dataset) or custom datasets can be used.

### Prerequisites

1. Python 3.x installed on your system.

## Future Enhancements

- Add more features like location, age of the house, and lot size.
- Explore other machine learning models (e.g., Decision Trees, Random Forests) for comparison.
- Implement a web interface for users to input house details and get predictions.
